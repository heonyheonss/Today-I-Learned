Hereâ€™s a quick note on why I decided to maintain a separate repository for my TILs instead of keeping them in my main profile repo.

A profile repository's primary goal is to serve as a clean, professional introduction to who I am and what I do. On the other hand, a TIL repo is a living document of my learning journey and code snippets. Mixing these two would lead to a messy and hard-to-follow commit history.

I think of it like a house: my profile is the front lobby, designed to welcome visitors, while my TIL repo is my personal library, filled with notes and discoveries.

This separation allows each repository to serve its unique purpose effectively. It keeps things organized, making it easier for me (and others!) to track my progress and manage the content.
